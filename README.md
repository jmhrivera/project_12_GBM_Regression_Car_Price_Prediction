# Project 12: Gradient Boosting Models for Car Price Prediction

## Overview
Rusty Bargain, a used car sales service, is developing an application to attract new customers. With this app, users can quickly determine the market value of their car. Given a dataset of car specifications, equipment versions, and prices, the goal was to build a model to determine the market value of a car.

## Requirements
Rusty Bargain is interested in:
- The quality of the prediction
- The speed of the prediction
- The time required for model training

## Dataset Description
The dataset is stored in the file `car_data.csv`. The relevant columns include car specifications, equipment versions, and historical prices.

## Project Structure
- `data_preparation.py`: Code for loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Code for creating and encoding features.
- `model_training.py`: Code for training various machine learning models.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Code for testing and evaluating the models.
- `results_summary.py`: Code for summarizing the results and providing conclusions.
